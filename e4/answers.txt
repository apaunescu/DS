1) Yes, if we look at our population density, the highest amount of people tend to sit around the 15-20 degree range, with around 17 degrees having had the highest population density, so therefore we can see a correlation between population density and temperature. We can also look at the extremes of our x axis and see less density.

2) This is faster in this case because our file isn't that large (relative to big data), and uncompressing our data means a longer time to read in (as the file would be larger).
